# Smart Home Object Detection using YOLOv3

This project implements a smart home system that utilizes YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) for object detection. The system is designed to detect and recognize various objects within the home environment, allowing for automated monitoring, security, and control.

## Overview

The smart home object detection system is built on top of the YOLOv3 deep learning model, which is capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time with high accuracy. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of home-related objects, including furniture, appliances, and other household items.

## Features

- Real-time object detection: The system can detect objects in real-time using live video feeds from cameras placed within the home.
- Customizable alerts: Users can define specific events or objects to trigger alerts, such as detecting an intruder or identifying a misplaced item.
- Integration with smart devices: The system can interface with other smart home devices, allowing for automated actions based on detected objects. For example, turning on lights when a person enters a room or adjusting the thermostat based on occupancy.
- Remote monitoring: Users can remotely access the system and view live object detection feeds through a web or mobile interface.
